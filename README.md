    Wandertrust provides a place for outdoor adventurers to plan, organize, and share their trips. Here at Wandertrust we know how important every detail is in keeping you safe in the places you wander. Our platform boasts map sharing, detail planning, weather information, and even live tracking for all your adventures. We are here to help you spend less time bouncing between planning apps, and more time bouncing between peaks, rivers, valleys, and anywhere else you may wander.

## About The Project

<div align="center">
  
 </div>


Wandertrust is a web application developed to solve the logistical problem that many outdoor athletes, recreationalists, and explorers face when planning their trips. Instead of having to bounce between multiple apps to check the weather at your location, communicate details like start and anticipated end times, share maps, and share your location with loved ones at home... Wandertrust provides a place for it all. 

Features include:

* Trip logistical tracking fields (i.e. start time, anticipated end time, etc.)
* Map upload/download features with integrations to Strava
* Resources for local SAR teams and local authorities
* Weather Forecast for the route location
* Ability to share/collaborate on your trip with other users and non-users

As adventurers ourselves, Wandertrust was built with an understanding of the challenges outdoor recreationalists face in managing their safety and keeping their loved ones and fellow recreators informed.

### PsyDiary Design

For our service architecture we decided to split our front end from our backend. The diagram below shows the way in which our services interact. For the backend repo, click the link below.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
<!-- ## Roadmap
To keep track of our progress while creating Psydiary, bugs that popped up, potential refactor ideas, and more... we utilized a [Notion Project Management Board](https://alluring-phlox-b74.notion.site/72a9807f1fec4b40a63d0fc8908cb7e8?v=aec33fee246f41b5bf8e7ae6ea7f9796) from Day 1.

We also used tools like Miro to diagram our database and service structure and Figma to create our wireframes.
